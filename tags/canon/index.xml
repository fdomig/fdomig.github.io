      <description>Canon EOS 60DAs I was assuming a couple of weeks ago, the Canon EOS 60D is finally here. Canon just posted a press release and added a product walkthrough video as well as a sample video shot with the Canon EOS 60D. The interesting parts: The camera features an 18mp DIGIC IV processor which is capable of 1080p H.264 video. As a new feature for any Canon EOS camera, the 60D will have an articulating 3&amp;#8243; LCD screen.</description>

      <description>Just last week Canon introduced the new EOS 550D (Rebel T2i) and this camera will soon be available. Anyone who &amp;#8211; like myself &amp;#8211; is playing with the idea to upgrade from a previouse three-digit EOS camera to the EOS 550D, will probably also checked out the Canon EOS 7D, which offers similar features but in some areas performs significantly better. The interesting thing about the EOS 7D and EOS 550D are, beside a lot of other outstanding features, the new HDSLR opportunities, ie HD movie recording with a digital SLR camera.</description>

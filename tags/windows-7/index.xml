      <description>Ok, I don&amp;#8217;t like Microsoft and Windows. I did like Windows XP for a while but never tried Vista because of the bad things I saw at my friends computers. Recently I installed Windows 7 as second OS on my MacBook Pro. And my deepest despair turned into someting good. I already tried to install Windows 7 with Parallels in OS X a couple of weeks ago, got several bluescreens and thought about never trying Windows 7 again.</description>

      <description>Yes I was interested in the new Windows 7. I yesterday downloaded the Windows 7 Release Candiate, which should be stable enough to try on my Macbook Pro. Economically as I am, I did not want to waste a blank DVD and that was the reason I choose Parallels to install Windows as a virtual machine.
First time: Failure during boot, no reaction of the windows system.
Second time: Better try, windows crashed after the copy of all Windows specific data with the typically bluescreen (which has not changed since Windows 95).</description>

      <title>Annotations with Symfony2</title>

      <description>With Symfony2 much configuration can be added directly to actions with annotations. With Symfony1 there have been cache.yml, route.yml, security.yml and many more configuration files for a single controller. This has not changed with Symfony2. You still are able to configure your (bundle) controller with single files. However, there is a new way which offers more flexibility and adds the configuration right to the place where it is used: to the specific action as meta-info with some sort of annotations.</description>

      <title>Should my next project use Symfony2?</title>

      <description>In a couple of hours, the Symfony Live event in Paris is going to start. You can expect Fabien Potencier to release Symfony 2.0 at the keynote he is holding on March 3rd at 17:30.This is actually not a big deal since Symfony2 has been around for a couple of months. The big question is, should you already start developing your next project with Symfony2? There is no definite answer to that but what you can expect is a &amp;#8220;not so much&amp;#8221; changing API and already robust Framework right from the start.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During my computer science studies at the Vorarlberg University of Applied Sciences I wrote my bachelor thesis about &amp;#8220;Automatic Anti-Pattern Corrections for PHP&amp;#8221;. As a fan of the open source philosophy, I want to share my work with others. I invite everyone to contribute to the great lex-pass project and this approach to better PHP software. Please share your thought and ideas on this with me and others by leaving a comment or sending me a message.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Here we go. Fabien Potencier last week released the preview website for symfony 2.0 (symfony reloaded). Me, as a long time PHP and symfony user this preview shows a lot of new interesting stuff comming to web development with symfony. A Quick-Tour of Fabiens newest baby is also available and points out major changes to the framework. First thing to notice is the completly changed directory structure. Another major step is the use of &amp;gt;= PHP 5.</description>

      <title>Symfony Support in NetBeans 6.8 Announced</title>
      <link>http://seric.at/2009/07/12/symfony-support-in-netbeans-6-8-announced/</link>

      <description>The NetBeans Team has announced to support not just PHP 5.3 which was released earlier last week but also Symfony in the next release (6.8)!
Because I am not very pleased with the PHP support within Eclipse PDT, I am currently using VIM for PHP, and specially, Symfony development.
Since Pierre told me recently that the PHP support for NetBeans is getting better and better, I am really looking forward to the next NetBeans release.</description>

      <title>Symfony 1.2 introduces REST</title>

      <description>As Fabien just posted on the Symfony Blog the next major release of Symfony &amp;#8211; Symfony 1.2 &amp;#8211; will introduce a quite cool feature to the framework. It will be possible to add a hidden form element to add REST inforrmation to the form and get the REST state with sfRequest::getMethod(). This is quite useful and adds native support for PUT and DELETE from the browser.</description>

      <title>Symfony 1.1 Ajax Form Validation</title>
      <link>http://seric.at/2008/08/12/symfony-1-1-ajax-form-validation/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.symfony-project.org/blog/2008/06/30/the-wait-is-over-symfony-1-1-released&#34;&gt;Symfony 1.1 was released&lt;/a&gt;, I am working with it. I adept a existing Symfony 1.0 application to 1.1. This process is quite tricky and needs a lot of research to get the result that I want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I faced a problem with a form which I submit via an Ajax request, I found a pretty nice solution in doing this with Symfony 1.1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
